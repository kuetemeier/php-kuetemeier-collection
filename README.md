# Archived

As I switched to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and other technologies for web-development,
I'm no longer activily maintaining this repo. This is why it has to go into archive / read-only mode.

Some of the code may still be relevant for some of you. Feel free to use ist, but I have no time to support you on this journey.
